# Outlaw Rendering Engine
A C++ rendering engine using OpenGL

### How to compile
* First of all you need GLFW binaries, you can download pre-compiled binaries or compile them by yourself.
All instructions on how to compile GLFW are [here](http://glfw.org)
* When you have the binaries, place them in a `lib` folder in the root of the repo
* NOTE: On Windows, when using MinGW, you will have to rename the DLL to `libglfw3.so`
* Create a `bin` folder
* If you use GCC or MinGW, you can compile using `compile.sh` or `compile.bat` based on your system.
* Place the shared library in the bin folder
* You can now run the test program

### Dependencies
* Uroboro
* GLFW 3
