# Uroboro
A math library for videogames in C++, header-only and for x86 platforms.
Includes common math functions approximations, vector and matrix calculations.

This library is meant to be used with `<cmath>`, as most functions are approximations and should be used
in specific contexts where speed is crucial.

### State of development
The project is being developed, most functions are stable and have been tested.

### How to use
The library is really easy to use, just include `uroboro.h` and you will be able to use vec4 and mat4 classes.
